* Motivation
Free/libre software grants users the 4 freedoms to run, study,
redistribute and improve programs.  Those programs are usually
extensible and flexible, and their configurations can be saved as text
files.  They're usually hidden files, i.e. prepended by a dot, hence
they're usually called *dotfiles*.  Users keep them so that their
computing environment is easily reproducible on a new machine.  That's
the scope of this project.

* Philosophy
Most of my computing orbitates around GNU Emacs.

/Are you ready to go down the rabbit hole?/

I started using GNU/Linux and GNU Emacs in August 2018.

My life changed forever.
